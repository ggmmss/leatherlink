  * Difference between the cost and total value is the indicator of purchase efficiency

  1. Utilize right grade for the right article (Raw Material / Down gradation Cost)
  * As planned, issue the right mix of grades for making different leathers
  * Monitor fall outs at crust stage and finished stage
  * Determine causes of fall out and if it is due to wet blue grade take corrective actions
